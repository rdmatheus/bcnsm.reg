Description: A comprehensive framework for regression and classification of positive continuous
    data based on the multivariate Box-Cox symmetric distributions generated by a normal scale 
    mixture copula. The package provides robust tools for fitting and assessing goodness-of-fit
    across a variety of data structures. In addition to classification, the multivariate regression
    setting allows for modeling d-dimensional positive continuous data as a function of explanatory 
    variables, utilizing the flexible Box-Cox symmetric marginal distributions. Conversely, the
    marginal regression setting enables the joint modeling of univariate observations, resembling 
    generalized estimation equation models. This approach offers considerable flexibility and
    applies to different data structures, including independent observations, time series, 
    longitudinal data, clustered data, and spatially correlated data.
