The `bcnsm.reg` package provides functions for fitting and evaluating
the goodness-of-fit of the multivariate and marginal BCNSM regression
models.

## Installation

The development version of the `bcnsm.reg` package is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/rdmatheus/bcnsm.reg). The installation of
the package can be done using the `devtools` package. If it has not been
previously installed, it can be added by executing the following command
in the `R` environment: `install.packages("devtools")`.

After installing the `devtools` package, if one is using *Windows*, it
may be necessary to install the current version of the `RTools` program,
available for download [at
here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools). Finally, the
development version of the `bcnsm.reg` can be installed by executing the
following command:

``` r
devtools::install_github("rdmatheus/bcnsm.reg")
```
